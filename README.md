# Tree Visualizer

## Overview
Tree Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users visualize and understand various tree data structures, including:
- **Binary Trees**
- **AVL Trees**
- **Red-Black Trees**

The tool provides an intuitive interface to create, modify, and visualize tree structures dynamically.

## Features
- **Binary Tree Visualization:** Insert, delete, and traverse nodes in a Binary Tree.
- **AVL Tree Balancing:** Automatic balancing of AVL Trees after insertions and deletions.
- **Red-Black Tree Operations:** Color-changing and rotations to maintain Red-Black Tree properties.
- **Traversal Options:** Supports Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, and Level Order traversals.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple UI with graphical representation.
- **Real-time Updates:** Visual feedback on insertions, deletions, and balancing operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (D3.js for visualization)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Optional)
- **Algorithm Implementation:** JavaScript/Python for tree logic

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x** (if using Flask/Django backend)
- **Node.js & npm** (if using a JavaScript-based backend)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tree-visualizer.git
   cd tree-visualizer
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install flask  # For Flask backend
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npm install  # For Node.js backend
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py  # For Flask
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npm start  # For Node.js
   ```
4. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (or relevant port).

## Usage
1. Select the tree type (Binary Tree, AVL, or Red-Black Tree).
2. Insert values into the tree using the input box.
3. Observe how the tree dynamically updates and balances itself (for AVL & Red-Black Trees).
4. Use traversal buttons to see different tree traversal orders.
5. Delete nodes to visualize restructuring and balancing.
